## My languages

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python,cpp,cs,js,html,css)](https://skillicons.dev)

I started by using **C++** with my Arduino projects, but quickly moved to **python** as I realized how hard **C++** is.  
**Python** is still to this day my favorite programming language, but I learned quite a lot of new ones.

When I started using Unity and VisualStudio, I learned **C#** (what a nightmare), and I'm still not very comfortable with it.

Weirdly, **HTML** was one of the last programming languages I learned, and I learned **JavaScript** one or two years later.

My journey as a dev is quite unusual, but it helped me to learn lots of programming languages and frameworks.

## My workflow

Initially, I was using Sublime Text as my main code editor, but VS Code is so much better!  
And I honestly think that Godot is way better than Unity.

I mainly use Windows, but learning Linux can be usefull. And my favorite distro is mint.
